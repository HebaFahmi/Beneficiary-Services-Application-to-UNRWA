Project Description:
The GFO-Beneficiary-Services project aims to streamline and improve the provision of services to refugees in Gaza. 
It involves the development of a comprehensive web-based system that facilitates the management and delivery of various services. 
The system utilizes modern technologies and tools to ensure efficiency, scalability, and a user-friendly interface.

Technologies and Tools Used:

C# within the .NET framework using .Net Core and ASP.NET Web API: I have utilized C# and .NET technologies to develop the back-end of the system, ensuring robust and secure communication between the client and the server.
Microsoft SQL Server: The project involves working with a SQL Server database to store and manage data related to beneficiaries and their services.
.NET Core Identity: I have implemented authentication and authorization functionalities using .NET Core Identity, ensuring secure access to the system's features and resources.
Entity Framework and LINQ: These technologies have been utilized to interact with the database, perform data operations, and ensure data integrity.
Web API: I have developed RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Web API, enabling seamless integration with other systems and facilitating data exchange.
Azure DevOps: The project is developed within an Azure DevOps environment, which provides version control, continuous integration, and project management capabilities, ensuring efficient collaboration within the development team.
Front-end Technologies: The front-end of the system is built using Metronic 8, which includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. These technologies have been leveraged to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for beneficiaries and system administrators.
Services Provided to Refugees in Gaza:
The GFO-Beneficiary-Services project aims to offer a range of essential services to refugees in Gaza, which may include:
